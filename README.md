# Rob & Dad's Whisky Tracker

A project for me and my Dad to track what whisky we've tried and what we thought of them.

**Note**: This is currently still being built.

## Project Motivation

Me & my Dad can always say to each other that we should start tracking what whisky we have bought or received so that we can continue to try new whiskies.

Since I love to code and solve problems, I thought I'd just try and solve this problem with a new web app.

## About the Project

The project is, as always, another learning opportunity.
